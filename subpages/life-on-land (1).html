                            Forests cover nearly 31% of our planet’s land area. From the air we breathe, to the water we drink, to the food we eat forests sustain us. 
                            Forests are home to more than 80% of all terrestrial species of animals, plants, and insects. However, biodiversity is declining faster than at any other time in human history. 
                            Biodiversity and the ecosystem services it underpins can also be the basis for climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies as they can deliver benefits that will increase the resilience of people to the impacts of climate change.<br><br>

                    <div>
                        <p class="intro">
                            Lost forests mean the disappearance of livelihoods in rural communities, increased carbon emissions, diminished biodiversity and the degradation of land. 
                            While forest loss remains high, 2020 data show that the proportion of forests in protected areas and under long-term management plans increased or remained stable at the global level and in most regions of the world
                            Deforestation and forest degradation are responsible for nearly 20 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. 
                            The loss of forests and other critical ecosystems undermines the essential services they provide, 
                            including carbon storage, water flow regulation, and soil fertility.

                        <p class="intro">
                            Increased demand for animal protein, a rise in intense and unsustainable farming, the increased use and exploitation of wildlife, and the climate crisis are all driving the increased emergence of zoonotic diseases  diseases transmitted from wildlife to people  like COVID-19.
                            An estimated two million individuals each year pass away from neglected zoonotic illnesses, the majority of whom reside in low- and middle-income nations. 
                            The same outbreaks have the potential to seriously harm cattle herds in underdeveloped nations, resulting in fatalities, significant disease, and lost productivity—a serious issue that puts hundreds of millions of small-scale farmers in extreme poverty.

                    <div>
                        <p class="intro">
                            Recycling, eating a sustainably derived, locally based diet, and simply consuming what we need are a few ways we may contribute. 
                            To avoid disturbing wildlife, we must appreciate it and limit our involvement in ecotourism activities to those conducted legally and responsibly. 
                            Healthy ecosystems sustain well-managed protected areas, which in turn maintain human health. Thus, ensuring the residents are involved in creating and administrating these protected zones is essential.<br><br>
                            Small Actions add up:<br>
                                01. Avoid using pesticides that end up in rivers and lakes, as they are ultimately harmful to wildlife all along the food chain.<br>
                                02. Never buy products made from threatened or endangered species.<br>
                                03. Recycle used paper and go paperless when possible.<br>
                                04. Eat less meat. The production and distribution of meat has a huge impact on greenhouse gas emissions.<br>
                                05. Buy recycled or previously used products when possible.<br><br>
